 * Have the built-in dispatcher run a thread on the CPU by performing a context 
 * switch if necessary. 
 * 
 * If a context switch is necessary, the built-in dispatcher takes exactly one 
 * simulator clock cycle to execute. If a context switch is not necessary 
 * (because the CPU is idle and the thread is new) dispatching is instantaneous.
 * 
 * (1) Any new thread scheduled without spending time on the ready queue will 
 *     be dispatched in the clock tick it was scheduled in.
 * 
 * (2) Any new thread scheduled after spending at least one clock tick on the ready 
 *     queue will be dispatched in the clock tick after the one it was scheduled in.
 * 
 * (3) Any thread scheduled after an IO operation completes will be dispatched in 
 *     the clock tick after the one it was scheduled in.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * (a) Thread T arrives in Tick 2 and the CPU is idle 
 *     dispatch(T) called in Tick 2
 *        T will start executing in Tick 2
 * 
 * (b) Thread T arrives in Tick 4 and the CPU is busy
 *     CPU becomes available in Tick 8
 *     dispatch(T) called in Tick 8
 *        T will start executing in Tick 9
 * 
 * (c) Thread T completes an IO operation in Tick 12 and the CPU is idle
 *     dispatch(T) called in Tick 12
 *        T will start executing in Tick 13
 * 
 * (d) Thread T completes an IO operation in Tick 18 but the CPU is busy
 *     CPU becomes available in Tick 22
 *     dispatch(T) called in Tick 22
 *        T will start executing in Tick 23
